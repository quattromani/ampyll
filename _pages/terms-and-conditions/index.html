        <p>You are responsible for User-Generated Content that you post. Under no circumstances will we be liable in any way for any User-Generated Content.</p>


        <p>This means that you, not PlaceWise Media, are entirely responsible for all User-Generated Content that you post and that you can be held personally liable for comments that are defamatory, obscene, or libelous, or that violate these Terms of Use, an obligation of confidentiality, or the rights of others. If any part of the User-Generated Content you post is not your original work, it is your responsibility to obtain any necessary permissions to post it.</p>

        <p>Because we do not control the User-Generated Content posted on or through this Site, we cannot and do not warrant or guarantee the truthfulness, integrity, suitability, or quality of that User-Generated Content. You also agree and understand that by accessing this Site, you may encounter User-Generated Content that you may consider to be objectionable. We have no responsibility for any User-Generated Content, including without limitation any errors or omissions therein. We are not liable for any loss or damage of any kind you claim was incurred as a result of the use of any User-Generated Content posted, e-mailed, transmitted or otherwise made available on or through this Site. The User-Generated Content posted on or through this Site expresses the personal opinions of the individuals who posted it and does not necessarily reflect the views of PlaceWise Media or any person or entity associated with PlaceWise Media.</p>

        <p>You own User-Generated Content, but we may use it. You own the copyright in any original User-Generated Content you post. We do not claim any copyrights in User-Generated Content. However, by using this Site you are granting us and our subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns, a nonexclusive, fully paid, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, transferable license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use, copy, modify, distribute, publicly display and perform, publish, transmit, remove, retain repurpose, and commercialize User-Generated Content you post in any and all media or form of communication whether now existing or hereafter developed, without obtaining additional consent, without restriction, notification, or attribution, and without compensating you in any way, and to authorize others to do the same. For this reason, we ask that you not post any User-Generated Content that you do not wish to license to us, including any confidential information or product ideas.</p>

        <p>We may disclose and/or remove User-Generated Content. PlaceWise Media reserves certain rights. We reserve the right (but do not assume the obligation) to</p>
