<p>On Wednesday, Instagram debuted their newest in-app feature: Stories. Instagram Stories enables users to post their own series of images or videos, called &ldquo;Stories,&rdquo; that are only visible for 24 hours. This new feature looks surprisingly identical to Snapchat &ndash; and Instagram knows it. CEO Kevin Systrom admitted on Wednesday at the launch that, <em><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2016/08/02/silicon-copy/">&ldquo;[Snapchat] deserves all the credit.&rdquo;</a></em></p>

<p>Despite its (more than) 300 million users, active daily Instagram users were only sharing about 80 million photos a day before Instagram Stories came into play. This number is far less than what Snapchat users normally share &ndash; about 10 billion stories per day. Essentially, Instagram has now created one platform to share your pixel-perfect photos plus all the moments in-between, possibly eliminating the need for users to switch back-and-forth between the two apps.</p>

<p>So as a marketer, should you even continue to post on Snapchat?</p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<p>Sharing stories to all of your friends is just one of the features of Snapchat that has made the platform so popular. Snapchat is still the go-to social media platform to watch curated content from around the world via Snapchat&rsquo;s &ldquo;Live Stories&rdquo; feed and to engage with content from their &ldquo;Discovery&rdquo; publishers. For Snapchat&#39;s younger audience, it continues to be the leading app for interacting and chatting with friends and peers.</p>

<p>Snapchat is also unique because of its selfie-lenses and geofilters, which Instagram lacks (for now). These hot graphic overlays are updated daily and also change depending on the user&rsquo;s geographical location, incentivizing users to constantly check their filters to see what&#39;s new. With the ability to create and customize geofilters, users can promote their brand to their following with ease. This type of 3rd party promotional reach is exclusive to Snapchat, and is extremely advantageous for advertisers.</p>

<p>For brands that have already built a strong following on Instagram, your Instagram Stories will now have exposure to that same following and audience. However, the order in which your Instagram Stories appear to a user is completely based on that user&rsquo;s interactions with your normal Instagram posts. Consequently, any content you post less likely to be seen by your less-engaged users. In this case, Snapchat&rsquo;s chronological listing of users&rsquo; stories gives your brand a higher chance of being viewed by your followers.</p>

<p>Additionally, Snapchat&rsquo;s user demographic skews younger than Instagram&rsquo;s, so continuing to post on both platforms will ensure that neither your Snapchat or Instagram followers are missing out on your shared content.</p>

<p>What remains the same for both Snapchat and Instagram Stories? Both of these apps&rsquo; users are looking for authentic voices. Instagram will still be the home for beautiful photos, but now it&#39;s also a place to show off those real-time, &ldquo;imperfect&rdquo; moments.</p>

<p>So, what to do now? If you already have a following on Instagram, start posting Snapchat-like content (or even the same content &ndash; if you save your individual Snapchat Snaps and Stories, you can easily share them on Instagram, too!) and see how your audience reacts.</p>
