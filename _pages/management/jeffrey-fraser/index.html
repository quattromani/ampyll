<p>Jeff Fraser has worked extensively in the mobile commerce, web commerce and billing services industries and has overseen sales from Boston, Hong Kong and Singapore. He’s adept at managing teams and bringing the vision of the organization into focus for real-world solutions for our clients.</p>

<p>Life before PlaceWise included work for XIUS where he identified and drove development of relevant, competitive solutions for the U.S. and global markets.  Jeff’s been on the leading edge of mobile technology/commerce integration and an advocate for the growth and opportunity in the field since its inception.</p>

<p>Outside the office, Jeff is a big U.S. history buff, with particular interest in our presidents and their lives.  Between periods of historic enlightenment, he keeps himself humble by coaching his teen daughters in soccer and basketball.</p>
