<p>PlaceWise Media got its start about 17 years ago as MallFinder.&nbsp; Since then, we&rsquo;ve grown to be the leading national digital marketing services provider to the shopping center industry and affiliate partner to hundreds of grocery retailers.&nbsp; But you can read about that elsewhere on our site.&nbsp; What you really want to know is what it&rsquo;s like to work at PlaceWise.</p>

<p>We are a collaborative, flexible, creative team (ask us about our infamous annual white elephant gift exchange). We&rsquo;re an active crew &ndash; lots of bike-riders in the house &ndash; and we love being a part of the action downtown. There are sports fans, movie buffs and more than a few musicians in our midst. No corporate drones here &ndash; our executive team encourages individuality, an entrepreneurial spirit, and provides opportunity for big thinkers who want to make a difference in the company.&nbsp; The pace is fast and the vibe is dynamic and stimulating!</p>

<p><em>As an equal opportunity employer, we hire without consideration to race, religion, national origin, age, gender, sexual orientation, marital status, veteran status or disability.</em></p>
